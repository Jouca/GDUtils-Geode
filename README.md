* This also includes the new difficulty faces, and the new **Legendary** and **Mythic** rating.
* Notifications are **highly customizable**, you can set the __position__, __size__, and __how long they can stay on screen!__
* You can also set when notifications **should appear** or **not appear**! This includes __being shown in levels__, __in the editor__, __etc__.

* Leaderboards are now **infinite**! You can see the placement of every Geometry Dash players (registered with [Updated Leaderboards](https://discord.gg/HpC5Xc3JMh)) with this one.

### View Demon List Placement

### Level URL Sharing Feature (Windows Only)
* You can share levels easily by copying the URL of it and sending it to your friends! Or you can quickly go to a level by going to `https://gdutils.com/{levelid}` (Replacing `{levelid}` with the ID of the level)

### Auto-Mute Spotify (or any application)
* Allows you to **auto mute Spotify** or any other applications when you are __playing a level__, __playtesting in the editor__, and more!
* **IMPORTANT for Mac Users:** Geometry Dash may request access to "System Events" and another app for muting Spotify or another application. This allows the game to detect running applications.

### Custom backgrounds
* Custom your **backgrounds colors** or you can even make it **transparent**!

### Extra additions to Friends List
* The additions added include being able to **search usernames** if you have a long friend list, or using the **scroll buttons**!
